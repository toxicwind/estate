### Mode

{{mode}}

### Changed Files ({{len files}} files, +{{totalAdded}}/-{{totalRemoved}} lines)

{{#if files.length}}
{{#table files headers="File|+/-|Type"}}
{{path}} | +{{linesAdded}}/-{{linesRemoved}} | {{ext}}
{{/table}}

_No files to review._
{{/if}}
{{#if excluded.length}}
### Excluded Files ({{len excluded}})

### Distribution Guidelines

Use the `task` tool with `agent: "reviewer"` and a `tasks` array.
{{#when agentCount "==" 1}}Create exactly **1 reviewer task**.{{else}}Spawn **{{agentCount}} reviewer agents** in parallel.{{/when}}
{{#if multiAgent}}
Group files by locality, e.g.:
- Same directory/module → same agent
- Related functionality → same agent
- Tests with their implementation files → same agent
{{/if}}

### Reviewer Instructions

For each reviewer:
1. Stay focused on the assigned files.
2. {{#if skipDiff}}Run `git diff`/`git show` for the assigned files to pull the actual changes.{{else}}Work from the diff hunks below — they're already captured, so there's no need to re-run `git diff`.{{/if}}
3. Read full file context via `read` whenever it helps.
4. Call `report_finding` once per issue.
5. Call `yield` with the verdict when done.

{{#if skipDiff}}
