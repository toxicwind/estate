# Repository Quality Score output contract

## Input relationship

`checks.json` defines what an audit grades. `findings.json` records the result of
grading those checks. `metadata.json` proves which run and repository state the
findings describe. Repository Quality Score validates all three before using a
check result.

Canonical findings use schema `2.0.0` and the full catalog `checkId`. An
applicable evaluated check contributes according to status. A non-applicable
check is excluded. An applicable check that was not evaluated is excluded and
reduces assessment coverage.

## Score formulas

```text
check earned points = check weight × status point value

audit score = sum(check earned points)
              / sum(applicable evaluated check weights)
              × 100

overall score = sum(audit score × audit category weight)
                / sum(included audit category weights)
```

Scores use decimal arithmetic and half-up rounding to the precision in the
policy. The quality band is assigned after rounding.

## Coverage fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Catalog coverage | Loaded policy-listed catalogs divided by policy audit count |
| Audit coverage | Valid current-commit audit runs divided by policy audit count |
| Applicable-check coverage | Evaluated applicable checks divided by all known applicable checks in selected runs |
| Scored audit count | Selected audits with at least one applicable evaluated check |
| Non-applicable audit count | Completed audits that proved the whole domain does not apply |

Coverage and quality are intentionally separate. Missing evidence never becomes
an automatic pass or failure.

## Result status

`official` requires a canonical, catalog-compatible, complete, unfiltered,
non-degraded audit run for every policy audit on the current clean source commit.

`provisional` means a numeric score is available but one or more official
conditions are not met. `statusReasons` provides stable reason codes and human
messages.

`unavailable` means no valid category score can be calculated. In this case
`overallScore` and `qualityBand` are `null`.

## score.json

The file contains:

- output schema and scoring-policy versions;
- run identity and timestamps;
- target repository name and Git commit;
- result status and reasons;
- overall score and quality band;
- catalog, audit, and check coverage;
- per-audit scores and check counts;
- highest-impact deductions;
- missing audits and excluded candidates; and
- catalog versions and fingerprints used by the calculation; and
- the applied status points, check weights, and per-audit weights from the
  fingerprinted score policy.

The file does not duplicate raw evidence or absolute paths. Follow the relative
source report pointer to inspect evidence in the originating audit.

## score.md

The human report presents status warnings first, followed by coverage, category
scores, highest-impact deductions, excluded inputs, and the policy explanation.
An unavailable report never displays a fabricated numeric score.

## snapshot.md

The snapshot records worktrees inspected, candidates found and selected,
catalog versions, current commit, source cleanliness, and exclusion reasons. It
is diagnostic input inventory, not a second score report.

## metadata.json

Metadata contains the score run identifier, timestamps, skill and policy
versions, target commit, worktree-discovery mode, the applied score policy,
input file fingerprints, catalog fingerprints, and final status reason codes.
Its run identifier must match `score.json`.

Each JSON input is parsed and fingerprinted from the same stable byte snapshot.
Immediately before publication, the calculator rechecks every fingerprint plus
the target commit and source-tree cleanliness. A change triggers one complete
retry; a second change produces no new completion marker.

## Comparability

Compare two scores only when their scoring-policy versions match and every
included audit has a compatible catalog version. A changed policy or baseline
can change a score even when source code is unchanged.
